If you have installed all the above libraries but still can not run the program because of ModuleNotFoundError, it may because Anaconda installs them automatically for me when creating the environment.
(Because I use 'conda activate ...' to create environment, some libraries will be installed automatically by Anaconda when creating the environment.)
You can just continue installing these NotFound libraries until you are able to run the program.
